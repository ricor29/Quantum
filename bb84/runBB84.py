'''
 The BB84 QKD algorithm has the following steps:
Alice is distributing the key to Bob.d

Define a holder for the key.

ALICES HARDWARE
- Get access to a Qubit.

- Generate a classical bit with a QRNG.
- Generate a basis with a QRNG.
- Prepare message using state and basis.

BOBS HARDWARE
- Get access to a Qubit.

- Generate a classical bit with a QRNG.
- Measure message basis.

ALICE AND BOB CHECK BASIS AGREES OVER CLASSICAL CHANNEL.
If yes append to key.
